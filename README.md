# Build an Image Search Abstraction Layer

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-an-image-search-abstraction-layer

Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/query/lolcats%20funny?page=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/recent/. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story**: You can get the image URLs, description and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.

**User Story**: You can paginate through the responses by adding a `?page=2` parameter to the URL.

**User Story**: You can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
